## Overview 

We created this App as our product for the third and final project for UNC Bootcamp, Interactive MERN SPA Project. It was created and completed over the course of 10 days by our group of four students. We achieved this by utilizing knowledge and skills aquired throughout the course, and referencing past assighments and readings. We faced some challenges as a group such as, teammates had difficulty launching the website on their end. A problem resolved by altering codes on their connection, which did the trick! 
we also couldn't get the upload image feature to work, due to complications with cloudinary. An accomplishment through this project was applying HARVARD API to create the inspiration board. As a group, we decided to fork our repos instead of creating branches in one repo to prevent merge conflicts. Furthermore our group had great communication, teamwork, and coordination to succuessfully build our App. 

## Our App 

Our App, Art Club, is a social media platform that serves as a communnity board and interaction center for users to share knowledge, experience, and appreciation of Art through posts. Users have the option to either Log In or Sign Up upon launching the App. Once accessed, users will be able to view Inspiration Page, Profile, or Art Board. The Inspiration Page is a collection of artwork from HARVARD API users can view for ideas, muse, and inspo. Under Profile, users can post creative pieces, access past posts, make edits, and access comments. Finally on Art Board, users are able to view and observe other creators' posts and interact with other users through the comments.
